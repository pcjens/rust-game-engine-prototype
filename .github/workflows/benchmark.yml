  # Does a non-incremental optimized build of a game, and an incremental debug
  # build with a very trivial change, as a sort of benchmark for how long it
  # takes to compile a game using this engine. Of course, in CI, this will quite
  # probably be slower than on a developer machine (at time of writing, the
  # release build takes ~2.1 seconds on my desktop), and vary wildly between
  # runs just due to the CI environment, but this should serve as a rough data
  # point for estimating roughly how compile times are changing over the course
  # of developing the engine.
