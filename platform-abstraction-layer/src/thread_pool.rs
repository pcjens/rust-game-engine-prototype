//! Thread pool for running tasks on other threads.
//!
//! [`ThreadPool`] implements a FIFO task queue where the tasks are executed on
//! other threads, the amount of threads depending on how the [`ThreadPool`] is
//! constructed. As a fallback, single-threaded platforms are supported by
//! simply running the task in [`ThreadPool::join_task`].
//!
//! This module doesn't do any allocation, and isn't very usable on its own,
//! it's intended to be used  alongsideplatform-provided threading functions, by
//! the engine, to construct multithreading utilities.
