//! This crate mainly revolves around the [`Platform`] trait, which can be
//! implemented to provide a "platform implementation" for the game engine.
//! Otherwise, this crate mostly contains some low-level parts of the engine
//! which are necessarily needed to implement [`Platform`], such as some
//! multithreading utilities.
//!
//! This is split off of the main engine crate so that the engine and the
//! platform implementation can be compiled independently, which appears to
//! speed up compilation time.
