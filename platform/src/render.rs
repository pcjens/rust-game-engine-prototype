// Safety: manually checked for f32 typed x/y/u/v at the beginning with u8 typed
// r/g/b/a at the end.
// - The type must be inhabited: it is.
// - The type must allow any bit pattern: it does, f32 and u8 are Pod.
// - The type must not contain any uninit (or padding) bytes: it does not, it's
//   4-aligned and the first four fields are 4 bytes, and the last four are
//   1-byte aligned and there's 4 of them.
// - The type needs to have all fields also be `Pod`: it does.
// - The type needs to be `repr(C)` or...: yes, it is repr(C) and does not
//   specify padding or alignment manually.
// - It is disallowed for types to contain pointer types, `Cell`, `UnsafeCell`,
//   atomics, and any other forms of interior mutability: none of those in this.
// - More precisely: A shared reference to the type must allow reads, and *only*
//   reads: yes, no hidden inner mutability tricks.
